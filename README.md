# Arkanoid2.0
This is a NetBeans development package so it is recommended to run this on that IDE. The game was a joint effort of a 
colleague of mine. We split the work up evenly whilst making this game. It is a simple brick breaker type game made in Java
with event listeners, threads, abstract classes, polypmorphism, and java swing (Graphical User Interface).
Since he does not have a github account, I want to acknowledge his work by giving my friend, Javal Sheth, 50% of the credit.
